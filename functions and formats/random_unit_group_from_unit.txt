; Starts with random_unit_group_from_unit
random_unit_group_from_unit

; Each dummy unit can have one or more pools of cities where the script will work.
; Each entry should start with a unit line, with "unit" followed by the type name of the unit (NOT dictionary name!)
unit roman premarian

; Each pool is defined with a pool line, which contains the cities' names (NOT regions) that it affects.
; This line is then followed by a set of lines (unlimited) in which the units that are able to spawn are defined.
; The number at the end is the number of units that will be spawned (though units can be worth more than one unit is specified to later in their entry)
; To clarify the way this works: it will spawn units while n > 0. n is set to the number which is indicated here, and each unit spawned will take away n1 points from n. n1 is specified per unit.
pool Rome Arretium Ariminum 1

; Each unit line should start with the type name of the unit with its spaces replaced by underscores. (again, NOT the dictionary name)
; It is followed by numbers representing in the following order:
; chance of recruitment | number of extra men to take from the settlement (on top of the dummy unit men. Number may be negative to add men to the settlement)
; | chance of 0 exp | chance of 1 exp | ... | chance of 9 exp
; The last number is n1 mentioned earlier in the pool section.
; Note: it is assumed that all chances of recruitment within a pool have a total sum of 1, and the same goes for all the exp chances within a unit. Not doing this may cause trouble.
